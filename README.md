<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<div align="left">
  <p>✔︎ Passionate about computers, writing code, and solving complex problems. The more challenging the problem, the better.</p>
  <p>✔︎ Love exploring software architecture and building robust, scalable solutions from scratch.</p>
  <p>✔︎ A good grasp of Data Structures, Algorithms, and Software Design principles.</p>
  <p>✔︎ Currently working on these cool projects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>FunctionScout</b>: An API dependency monitoring tool that analyzes and visualizes function-level dependencies, alerting developers to function signature mismatches caused by API updates.</li>
    <li><b>Comment Invisibility Cloak</b>: A Chrome extension that helps block YouTube comments. I made this because I’d often find myself getting sucked into the comments while listening to music/podcasts on YouTube instead of staying focused. It’s my way of solving that little problem and learning how to build Chrome extensions along the way.</li>
  </ul>
